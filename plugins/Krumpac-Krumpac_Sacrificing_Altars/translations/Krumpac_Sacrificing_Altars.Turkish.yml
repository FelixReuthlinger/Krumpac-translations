Krump_Altar_BlackForest_Freya_Totem_Text: "Long ago, Freya was wandering through the world of the mortals, looking for something that would catch her eye. As she was walking in a forest, she saw a handsome young man named Ottar, who was weeping bitterly. Freya asked him why he was crying, and Ottar told her that he had lost all his wealth and possessions, including his ancestral land.Feeling sorry for Ottar, Freya decided to help him regain his property. She told him that she would give him a magic cloak that would help him win a contest against a man named Angantyr, who had taken over Ottar's land. The cloak would make Ottar invincible and ensure his victory in the contest.However, there was a catch. In order to win the cloak, Ottar had to prove his ancestry and noble lineage, as only those who had a heroic ancestry could wear the magic cloak. Ottar had no knowledge of his ancestry, as his family history had been lost over time. To help Ottar discover his ancestry, Freya took him to visit the dwarves, who were known for their knowledge and wisdom. The dwarves told Ottar that his ancestors were the legendary kings of the Geats, and that he was a descendant of the god Odin himself. Feeling proud and invigorated, Ottar went to the contest wearing the magic cloak that Freya had given him. He fought bravely against Angantyr, and with the help of the cloak, he was able to defeat him and reclaim his ancestral land.Overjoyed by Ottar's success, Freya took him as her lover and bestowed upon him the gift of poetry, which made him famous throughout the land. Ottar became known as Ottar the Skald, and he composed many beautiful and moving poems in honor of Freya and her many virtues. From that day on, Ottar and Freya remained close friends, and Ottar became one of the most celebrated poets of his time, thanks to the help and guidance of the beautiful and wise goddess of love and beauty, Freya."

Krump_Altar_BlackForest_Freyr_Totem_Text: "One day, Freyr received a visitor in his hall, a giantess named Gerd, who was said to be the most beautiful woman in all the nine worlds. Freyr was immediately smitten with Gerd and fell deeply in love with her. Despite his feelings for her, Freyr was hesitant to approach Gerd, as he knew that the giants were often hostile towards the gods. He consulted with his advisor, Skirnir, who offered to help Freyr win Gerd's hand in marriage.Skirnir set out on a dangerous journey to Jotunheim, the land of the giants, to speak with Gerd on behalf of Freyr. He offered her gold and precious gifts as tokens of Freyr's love and promised her that if she agreed to marry Freyr, she would become one of the most respected goddesses in all of Asgard. At first, Gerd was hesitant to agree, as she was unsure whether she could trust the gods. But Skirnir's persuasive arguments and the gifts he brought eventually won her over, and she agreed to marry Freyr.When Freyr learned of Gerd's decision, he was overjoyed, and a great feast was held in honor of the upcoming wedding. The gods and goddesses of Asgard gathered to celebrate, and it was said to be one of the most joyous occasions in the history of the gods. The marriage of Freyr and Gerd symbolized the union of the gods and giants, a coming together of two worlds that were often in conflict. It also demonstrated the power of love and the lengths to which one would go to be with the person they loved.From that day forward, Freyr's power only grew, and he became even more beloved among the people of the Viking world. His marriage to Gerd was seen as a sign of hope and prosperity, and it was said that their love would endure for all eternity."

Krump_Altar_Meadows_Baldur_Totem_Text: "Baldur was a beloved god who was known for his beauty, kindness, and wisdom. However, he was plagued by a terrible prophecy that foretold of his death, which would be brought about by mistletoe.To protect Baldur from this fate, his mother Frigg went to great lengths to ensure that all things in the world would swear an oath not to harm him. She went to every living and non-living thing in the world, except for the mistletoe plant, which she deemed too small and insignificant to pose any threat.However, the trickster god Loki discovered this oversight and crafted a spear made from mistletoe. One day, the gods had gathered to watch Baldur demonstrate his toughness. One by one, the gods would hurl stones and weapons at him, and the crowd would laugh as they bounced off harmlessly. Loki then tricked Baldur's blind brother, Hodr, into throwing the mistletoe spear at Baldur, killing him instantly.After Baldur's death, his body was taken to a meadow known as Breidablik, which was considered to be one of the most beautiful places in the entire Norse realm. There, his body was laid to rest and a totem was erected in his honor, so that all who passed by could pay their respects to the fallen god.The totem of Baldur in the meadows became a place of pilgrimage for the Norse people, who saw Baldur as a symbol of light, beauty, and goodness in the face of darkness and chaos. Even though he was gone, his memory and legacy lived on through the totem and the stories told about him, inspiring generations of Norse people to embody the virtues he represented."

According to the sagas, Bragi was married to the goddess Idun, who was the keeper of the golden apples that kept the gods young and immortal. Bragi once attended a feast in the hall of the giant Ægir, where the gods and giants gathered to drink and tell stories. When the conversation turned to poetry, Bragi was challenged to a contest of wits by a giant named Þrymr.Þrymr boasted that he was the greatest poet in all the realms, and he challenged Bragi to a competition to see who could compose the best poem. Bragi accepted the challenge and began to compose his verses. As Bragi recited his poem, the other gods and giants listened in awe. His words were so powerful that they caused the mead in Ægir's hall to turn into poetry, and everyone who drank it was filled with the spirit of inspiration.Þrymr, however, was not impressed. He mocked Bragi's poem and claimed that he could do better. He began to recite his own verses, but as he did so, he stumbled and made mistakes. The other gods and giants laughed and jeered, and Þrymr was forced to admit that Bragi was indeed the greatest poet in all the realms.From that day on, Bragi was revered as the god of poetry and inspiration. He was said to inspire poets and musicians, and his presence at a feast was thought to bring good luck and inspiration to all who attended."

Krump_Altar_Ocean_Njord_Text: "Njord was one of the Vanir, a group of gods who were in conflict with the Aesir, the ruling gods of Asgard. To end the conflict, the two sides agreed to a truce, and they exchanged hostages to show their commitment to peace. As part of the exchange, the Vanir sent Njord and his two children, Freyr and Freya, to live among the Aesir. Njord was placed in charge of the sea and its creatures, and he quickly became known for his wisdom and his skill as a fisherman.However, Njord's reputation was threatened by a powerful giant named Hymir, who claimed to be the greatest fisherman in all the nine worlds. Njord, never one to back down from a challenge, accepted Hymir's boast and proposed a fishing competition. The two fishermen set out in Hymir's boat, with Njord taking charge of the fishing line. As they rowed out to sea, Njord asked Hymir for the bait, and the giant handed him a large ox head. Njord was puzzled, but he went along with it, placing the ox head on the hook and casting the line into the water.After a short time, Njord felt a strong tug on the line, and he knew that he had caught something big. He began to reel in the line, but as he did so, the ox head began to slip off the hook. Njord quickly realized that he had been tricked, and that Hymir had used the ox head to sabotage his fishing line. Undeterred, Njord quickly came up with a plan. He took out his knife and cut off his own toe, using it as bait on the hook. This time, when he cast the line into the water, he felt an even stronger tug, and he knew that he had hooked something truly massive.With all his strength, Njord reeled in the line, and he and Hymir pulled up a giant sea serpent, which they had caught by its gills. The serpent was so massive that it stretched across both boats, and it writhed and thrashed in fury. Njord was declared the winner of the fishing contest, and he was hailed as the greatest fisherman in all the nine worlds. From that day forward, he was known as the ruler of the sea, and his reputation for wisdom and skill only grew."

Loki showed up anyway and demanded Odin honor an old vow to ..one day drink together. Angered at the slight, Loki began to insult each of the gods in turn, mocking their appearances, their deeds, and their accomplishments. He insulted Thor for being simple-minded, Odin for being old and one-eyed, and even Freyja, the goddess of love and beauty, for her promiscuity. The gods were furious at Loki's insults, but they were unable to strike back, as he was under the protection of the law of hospitality. After finally going too far, Thor threatened to smash Loki's head with a hammer. Fearing no other threats but those of Thor, Loki snuck out of the hall and attempted to escape by disguising himself as a salmon. The gods caught wind of his scheme and captured him, tying him to a rock.As punishment for his numerous insults over the years, the goddess Skadi placed a poisonous snake above his head that would drip venom on his head. Loki's wife stayed by his side, collecting the venom in a bowl and pouring it out periodically. When the bowl was moved to be poured, the few drops of poison that hit Loki's head would cause him to shudder in agony- and this is the source of earthquakes in Midgard. Once freed, Loki vowed to sow even more chaos than before."

The boar was so massive that it could barely move, but it had a fierce look in its eyes. Freyr was immediately captivated by the beast and decided to make it his own.Freyr approached the giant boar and offered it some food. Hildisvini was so hungry that it immediately accepted the offering and began to eat. After a while, the boar was so full that it couldn't move, so Freyr took the opportunity to tame it. He mounted the beast and rode it back to Asgard, the home of the Norse gods.When Freyr arrived at Asgard with the giant boar, he was greeted with great admiration and respect. The other gods were amazed by Hildisvini's size and strength, and they marveled at how Freyr was able to tame such a fierce beast.Freyr and Hildisvini became inseparable companions, and the boar became a symbol of Freyr's power and prosperity. Together, they went on many adventures, and Hildisvini proved to be a valuable ally in battle.In the end, Freyr's love for Hildisvini was so great that he could not bear to part with the giant boar. So, when Freyr died in battle, he was buried with Hildisvini by his side, so that they could be together forever.And so, the legend of Freyr and Hildisvini, the giant boar from the black forest, lived on in the hearts and minds of the Norse people for generations to come."
