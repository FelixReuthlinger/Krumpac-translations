The villager mapped the land, seeking refuge and supplies, but was forced to flee as chaos overtook their farm. The paths it marks will guide you to forgotten places, filled with hidden treasures and secrets. But beware—the land has been twisted by Loki’s hand. Not all who followed this map returned. Use it wisely, for it may be your key to survival."
