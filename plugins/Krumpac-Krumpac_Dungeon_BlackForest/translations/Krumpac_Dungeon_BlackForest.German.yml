GP_Loc_WoodFarm1_TEXT: "Look around, mortal. This was once the home of dwarves, master craftsmen who shaped wonders from the earth. Deep in the Meadows, they toiled, forging weapons and relics of immense power. But even this remote village could not escape the schemes of Loki, whose greed knows no bounds.\n\nIt was here that Loki discovered the Ásfang Steinn—an ancient stone, forged by the dwarves and imbued with powerful magic capable of imprisoning gods. Loki, seeking a weapon to challenge Thor, stumbled upon the Ásfang Steinn and saw a far greater prize. Entranced by its potential, Loki shattered the stone into shards, each capable of binding even the mightiest god.\n\nSearch these ruins carefully—you may find clues to the dwarves' defiance. If Loki’s shards remain, your journey will only grow darker."

Knowing he couldn’t capture Bragi, the god of poetry, by force, Loki concocted a subtle plan. He sought out the Nokken, dark water spirits led by Hafvidrkonungr, whose sorrowful song lured souls into the depths. Loki saw in him the perfect ally.\n\nTempting Bragi with tales of Hafvidrkonungr’s unmatched melody, Loki lured Bragi to the Nokken's cave. Unaware of the trap, Bragi set out to challenge the Nokken king’s song."

He raised his own voice, weaving a melody of light and hope to counter the Nokken king’s dirge. As their songs clashed, the cave filled with opposing forces.\n\nBut the deeper Bragi ventured, the stronger Hafvidrkonungr’s song grew. Loki revealed himself, mocking Bragi for falling into his trap. Hafvidrkonungr’s song was never meant to be mastered—it was meant to ensnare."

Powerless and silent, Bragi was trapped.\n\nLoki gave the shard to Hafvidrkonungr, commanding him to guard it deep within the cave. Bragi’s voice is now lost, locked away with the Nokken, where only the bravest dare to seek it."
