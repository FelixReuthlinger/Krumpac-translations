Krump_Loc_Maedows_Statue_Boar_Text: "One day, while Freyr was wandering through the black forest, he stumbled upon a giant boar named Hildisvini. The boar was so massive that it could barely move, but it had a fierce look in its eyes. Freyr was immediately captivated by the beast and decided to make it his own.Freyr approached the giant boar and offered it some food. Hildisvini was so hungry that it immediately accepted the offering and began to eat. After a while, the boar was so full that it couldn't move, so Freyr took the opportunity to tame it. He mounted the beast and rode it back to Asgard, the home of the Norse gods.When Freyr arrived at Asgard with the giant boar, he was greeted with great admiration and respect. The other gods were amazed by Hildisvini's size and strength, and they marveled at how Freyr was able to tame such a fierce beast.Freyr and Hildisvini became inseparable companions, and the boar became a symbol of Freyr's power and prosperity. Together, they went on many adventures, and Hildisvini proved to be a valuable ally in battle.In the end, Freyr's love for Hildisvini was so great that he could not bear to part with the giant boar. So, when Freyr died in battle, he was buried with Hildisvini by his side, so that they could be together forever.And so, the legend of Freyr and Hildisvini, the giant boar from the black forest, lived on in the hearts and minds of the Norse people for generations to come."

You can pray at any place the in the world, but where you choose to pray may affect the outcome! Praying is also backed by a skill system, which signifies your piety and connection to the gods. Some dieties will only acknowledge the prayers of the devout. Praying will also be required for game progress, for providing special ingredients to buildings, and more. But beware, the gods are mysterious and unpredictable. Their nature is such that they may punish you, or ignore you completely! To gain their favor, try bringing offerings to their holy places. Doing so will lessen their wrath, and yield greater benefits to the faithful."
