GP_StartTemple_Praying_Advise_Text: "Listen closely, mortal, for the gods of these lands are not easily swayed. In Valheim Reforged, there is a new way to commune with the Norse gods—a prayer system that will test your faith. To begin, type /pray in the chat window. But heed this: where you pray matters. The location may affect how the gods respond.\n\nYour connection to the gods is not just in words, but in your growing piety. As your devotion deepens, so too does the gods' watchful gaze. Some gods will not listen to those with shallow faith. Praying is crucial for your journey, helping you gather ingredients, build, and more.\n\nHowever, be wary. The gods are fickle, blessing you one moment and cursing you the next—or ignoring you altogether. If you seek their favor, bring offerings to sacred places to appease them and earn greater rewards."

I carry the Raven Hints—stories and guidance to help you understand this world, its dangers, and the crafting secrets you must master.\n\nNewcomers should heed these hints, or they risk getting lost or overwhelmed by the chaos Loki has sown. Experienced players, familiar with Valheim Reforged, may choose to silence me, but they do so at their own risk. These hints are more than guidance—they hold the key to your survival.\n\nTo enable Raven Hints, go to Valheim Settings -> Gameplay -> Activate Enable Raven Hints. You can always revisit these hints in the game compendium."
